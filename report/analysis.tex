\begin{itemize}
    \item Size of header vs size of packet
    \item Bandwidth utilization

\section{RDT Packet Data Size}

Several experiments were carried out to measure the effect of varying the RDT packet size. 

The maximum packet size supported by UDP datagrams is 65,507 for IPv4 (this analysis will not consider IPv6), therefore given a fixed header size of
