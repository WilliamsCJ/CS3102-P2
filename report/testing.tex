\section{Testing}

To test and verify the correct operation of RDT, two test programs \code{RdtClient.c} and \code{RdtServer.c} were created to send an arbitrary file between \code{pc7-082-l} and \code{pc7-085-l} using RDT. For test cases were delay, loss and a constrained data rate were introduced, \code{slurpe-3} was run on \code{pc7-087-l}.

\subsection{Methodology}

To test that RDT packets were delivered reliably and in-order, a 230KB JPEG file (\emph{dog.jpg}\textsuperscript{2}) was used as test file. This provided visible feedback as to the integrity of the data received by \code{RdtServer.c}. This integrity was also verified by calculating SHA1 checksums of both the sent and received files. \code{slurpe-3} was used to provide an emulated path with loss, delay and restricted data rate to test the reliability of RDT in degraded network conditions.

To collect RTT data for analysing the performance of RDT, two test programs \code{RdtClientRTT.c} and \code{RdtServerRTT.c} were created. These programs performed 10 rounds of transferring the same 230 KB file, to calculate a sample of 10 average RTT values. This was performed without slurpe-3 to give a true characterisation of performance. These results are included in \code{data/rtt-results.csv}.

\subsection{Results}

From the results in Table~\ref{tab:results} and Appendix~\ref{testing-screenshots} we can see the RDT performed as expected in a variety of degraded network conditions.
